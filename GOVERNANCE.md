# Governance Overview

The nflverse is led by the nflverse Core Team and managed by the community. 
That is, the community actively contributes to the day-to-day maintenance of the 
project, but the general strategic line is drawn by the nflverse Core Team. In 
case of disagreement, they have the last word. It is the nflverse Core Team's job 
to resolve disputes within the community and to ensure that the project is able 
to progress in a coordinated way. In turn, it is the communityâ€™s job to guide the 
decisions of the nflverse Core Team through active engagement and contribution. 

## Roles and responsibilities

This project has a large community of __users__ and __contributors__, a team of 
__Core Team developers__, and a __Core Lead__.

### Users

People who use packages, resources, and data from the nflverse are the most important 
members of the community; without these users, this project would have no purpose.

Users are encouraged to participate in the life of the project and the community 
as much as possible. User contributions help ensure that the project is satisfying 
users' needs. Common user activities include (but are not limited to):

- evangelising about the project
- asking and answering on community forums
- providing moral support (a 'thank you' goes a long way)

Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often find 
themselves becoming more and more involved. Such users may then go on to become 
contributors, as described above.

### Contributors

Contributors interact with the project on GitHub by filing new issues, improving 
existing issues, or submitting pull requests. Anyone can become a contributor: 
there is no expectation of commitment to the project, no required set of skills, 
and no selection process. The only obligation is to follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

<!-- Specific advice for contributing to the project can be found in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). -->

### Core Team

Core Team developers are collectively responsible for day-to-day development of 
the package, including responding to issues and reviewing pull requests. They are 
GitHub administrators and [package authors](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse/blob/HEAD/DESCRIPTION), 
which means that they have the ability to make changes to project code, and receive 
credit when others cite the package.

While Core Team developers can modify code directly, this ability is rarely used. 
Instead, changes are proposed as pull requests, and are only merged after they 
have been reviewed by at least one other core developer. Changes to the API 
(especially breaking changes) must also be approved by the Core Lead. 

As a consensus group, the Core Team developers are also responsible for:

* Setting, and clearly communicating the strategic objectives of the project
* Ensuring that the project survives in the long term
* Deciding on organization-level policies, procedures, and decisions

Core Team developers are recruited from contributors. An invitation to join the Core 
team can be extended to anyone who has made a major contribution, either through 
a small number of large changes, or a consistent pattern of smaller contributions. 
Any existing Core developer can propose a contributor be invited to the Core Team 
by emailing or messaging the Core Lead. The Core Lead will the confirm the invitation 
with the other Core Team developers.

The Core Team developers of the nflverse project are:

* [Tan Ho](https://github.com/tanho63)
* [Sebastian Carl](https://github.com/mrcaseb)
* [Ben Baldwin](https://github.com/guga31bb)
* [John Edwards](https://github.com/john-b-edwards)
* [Lee Sharpe](https://github.com/leesharpe)

All Core Team developers are bound by the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Core Lead

[Tan Ho](https://github.com/tanho63) is the Core Lead.

The Core Lead is a single individual, voted for by the Core Team. Once someone 
has been appointed Lead, they remain in that role until they choose to retire, or 
the Core team casts a two-thirds majority vote to remove them.

The Core Lead has no additional authority over other members of the Core Team: the 
role is one of coordinator and facilitator. The Lead is also expected to ensure 
that all governance processes are adhered to, and has the casting vote when the 
project fails to reach consensus. Where required, the Core Lead may represent the
Core Team

The Core Lead is bound by the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
